            <h1>Understanding the Relational Needs of Your Bird</h1>
            <p>Birds are intelligent, social creatures that require emotional care and interaction to thrive. Learn how
                to build a strong bond and support your bird’s well-being.</p>

            <h2>Why Emotional Health Matters</h2>
            <p>Birds come in all sizes—from the tiny Cuban bee hummingbird to the massive ostrich. While many birds fly,
                some do not. Despite their differences, all birds share a need for social interaction and mental
                stimulation.</p>

            <h2>Signs of Depression in Birds</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced appetite</li>
                <li>Increased irritability</li>
                <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
                <li>Changes in song tone (more solemn or quiet)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you notice these signs, consult your veterinarian. Early detection can significantly improve your
                bird’s health and longevity.</p>

            <h2>Supporting Your Bird’s Emotional Needs</h2>
            <p>Spend time talking, whistling, or playing music for your bird. Use toys, mirrors, and interactive play to
                reduce boredom. Birds are highly responsive to routine and companionship—daily interaction is key
