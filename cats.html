            <h1>Feeding and Caring for Your Cat by Life Stage</h1>
            <p>Cat care changes as your feline companion ages. Learn how to meet their feeding, health, and
                environmental needs from kittenhood through senior years.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="info">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most
                popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care
                and
                diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
                well-being
                of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>

            <h2>0–4 Weeks: Nursing and Early Growth</h2>
            <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing)
                directly
                nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
                progressing steadily.
                If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly
                either with a bottle
                or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too many siblings competing for milk</li>
                <li>Gastrointestinal issues</li>
                <li>Poor environmental conditions (extreme temperatures or unsanitary space)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4 Weeks–1 Year: Weaning and Kitten Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after
                birth.
                According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens
                at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
                ounces
                of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water
                can be added
                to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are
                needed for
                growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements.
                You should
                always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 cup of dry food daily</li>
                <li>6–9 oz of wet food daily</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If kittens struggle with hard food, add water to soften it. Look for food labeled for kittens—it provides
                the extra nutrients needed for growth and energy. Check with your vet for breed-specific dietary advice.
            </p>

            <h2>1–7 Years: Adult Cat Nutrition and Routine</h2>
            <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level
                of
                activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats
                all
                day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the
                day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>

            <h2>7+ Years: Senior Cat Adjustments</h2>
            <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
                this
                age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
                packaged
                foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a
                category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
                proteins.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose specific protein sources (e.g., "salmon")</li>
                <li>Avoid generic labels (e.g., "fish") which often indicate low-quality byproducts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Senior cats may also benefit from more frequent checkups and tailored diets to manage age-related
                conditions.</p>
