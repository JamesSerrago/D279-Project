            <h1>Supporting the Emotional Well-Being of Your Bird</h1>
            <p>Birds are incredible creatures with unique relational needs. Understanding their emotional health is
                essential to ensuring their well-being.</p>

            <h2>Bird Behavior and Emotional Needs</h2>
            <p>Birds range in size from the tiny Cuban bee hummingbird to the large ostrich. While many birds fly, some
                do not. All birds, regardless of type, require emotional support and companionship to thrive.</p>

            <h2>Signs of Depression in Birds</h2>
            <p>Birds can experience sadness or depression due to various causes, such as illness, loss of a companion,
                or boredom. Watch for these signs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced appetite</li>
                <li>Increased irritability</li>
                <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
                <li>Changes in song tone—more solemn or quiet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you notice these symptoms, consult your veterinarian. Early intervention can improve your bird’s
                lifespan and overall happiness.</p>

            <h2>Ways to Support Your Bird</h2>
            <p>Interact regularly with your bird by talking, playing music, or offering toys and enrichment. Building
                trust and offering stimulation are key to preventing emotional distress in birds.</p>
